The primary goal of this Flask application is to monitor real-time train chart statuses and promptly notify users via email when their desired train charts are prepared and vacant seats become available for booking. Often, travelers struggle to predict the timing of seat availability, which can complicate securing bookings. This application tracks the live status of train charts and promptly alerts users as soon as vacant berths are released.

On heavily trafficked and high-demand routes, available seats are scarce and quickly taken once they are released. Therefore, users must act swiftly upon receiving notifications to secure their bookings.

For example, imagine a traveler planning a journey from station A to C with station B as an intermediate stop (A->B->C). Initially booking a ticket from A to C, the traveler ends up on a waitlist and does not receive a confirmed ticket after the chart is prepared. Consequently, they opt to travel only up to station B, where very few seats are available following chart preparation. Typically, the traveler receives message confirmation of their booked ticket (A->C) several minutes to hours after the chart is prepared, risking missing out on booking the vacant seats for the A->B journey. This application ensures users stay informed about chart preparation statuses and the timing of vacant seat releases, enabling them to book promptly.

In another scenario, a traveler plans to journey from A to C but faces a long waitlist. Uncertain about receiving a confirmed ticket, they prefer to book only when confirmed seats are available to avoid cancellation charges associated with waitlisted tickets. This application addresses such concerns by promptly sending emails upon chart preparation and the availability of vacant seats
